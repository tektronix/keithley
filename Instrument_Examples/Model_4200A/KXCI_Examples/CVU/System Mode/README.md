# CVU

These examples are for external control of the 4200A CVU in system mode with the KXCI application running on it and using a PC.

Requirements

* Software: Any Clarius version
* KXCI terminal setup: String Terminator = None, Reading Delimiter= String Terminator, Set to ethernet mode
* KXCI Configuration (set within KCON): TH, String Terminator = None, Reading Terminator = String Terminator
* Python: Version 3.6 or later
* Dependencies:  **[instrcomms.py](https://github.com/tektronix/keithley/blob/main/Instrument_Examples/General/Instrument_Communication_Resouces/instrcomms.py)**, time, pyVISA
* Optional dependencies (Need for the code to run, but can be modified to run with it. All lines are marked where these can be removed) plotly.express, pandas
