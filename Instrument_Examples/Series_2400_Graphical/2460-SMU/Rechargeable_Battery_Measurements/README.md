# Rechargeable Battery Measurements

This example application demonstrates how to use a single 2460 to perform automated 
battery discharge and charge cycle testing.

You will find examples for both the SPCI and the TSP command set implementations. 
* Each is written in Python 3
* Each uses sockets-based communications to control the 2460
