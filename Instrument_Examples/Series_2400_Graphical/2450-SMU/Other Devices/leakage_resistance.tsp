This example is from the 2450 User's Manual. Check there for more details on running this example.

The following TSP code performs a capacitor leakage measurement by sourcing 20 V and measuring
    the resulting leakage current. The Duration Loop trigger model template applies the voltage for 60
    seconds and makes measurements at 200 ms intervals. After the duration time, the capacitor is
    discharged at 0 V and the output is turned off.

After the code is executed, the measurement results are displayed in the Instrument Console of Test
    Script Builder. From the Instrument Console, you can copy the data into a spreadsheet for graphing.
