* Delta_Measurement_Example.py<br>
--- Makes a set of delta measurements with the 6221/2182A and returns the resistance to a file<br>
--- Settings are entered using a simple GUI created by the instrgui.py module<br>
--- Requires the instrcomms and instrgui files which can be found at [Instrument Communication Resources](../General/Instrument_Communication_Resouces) and [Creating GUIs](../General/Creating_GUIs), respectively.<br>

* Differential_Conductance_Example.py<br>
--- Makes a set of differential conductance measurements with the 6221/2182A and returns the conductance values to a file.<br>
--- Settings are entered using a simple GUI created by the instrgui.py module.<br>
--- Requires the instrcomms and instrgui files which can be found at [Instrument Communication Resources](../General/Instrument_Communication_Resouces) and [Creating GUIs](../General/Creating_GUIs), respectively.<br>
