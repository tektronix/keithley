# 2281S-20-6 Battery Models

This Directory holds battery models for the Model [2281S-20-6 Precision DC Supply & Battery Simulator](https://www.tek.com/tektronix-and-keithley-dc-power-supplies/2281s).  You can use these models to simulate a variety of batteries. To contribute your own models, file a pull request against the `dev` branch, being sure to follow the [Contribution Guidelines](../../../README.md#contributing).  To request a battery model, open an issue with the "Code Request" template, but please be aware that Keithley cannot fulfill every request for battery models.

Most models have the conditions they were generated with listed in their `*_SetupAndRawData.csv` files, along with the raw data collected during model generation.

## Generating 2281S-20-6 Battery Models

New Models can be generated by discharging a real battery using a Keithley Model 2450, 2460, or 2461 SourceMeter&reg; Source Measure Unit and the script provided in the [Model Generation Script folder](./Model_Generation_Script).  There is an instructional PDF included in the folder with the script, please read it carefully as not following the instructions can result in dangerous conditions while discharging your battery, particularly for Lithium Ion based batteries.
